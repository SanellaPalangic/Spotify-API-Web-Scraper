The Web Scraper Application is a Python-based tool that integrates with the Spotify API to analyze and visualize artist popularity trends from playlists.
Key features include fetching detailed playlist information, extracting unique artists, and saving their popularity scores over time into a CSV file. 
The application also provides the ability to plot popularity trends for individual artists, enabling users to observe changes in popularity across different timeframes. 
This program leverages Spotify's OAuth for secure access and supports handling large playlists through pagination.
